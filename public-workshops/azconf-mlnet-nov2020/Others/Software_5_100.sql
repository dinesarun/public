For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn''t go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful. On the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don''t expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.It''s important to note that there''s a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn''t covered here...it''s possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :) As I said above, if you''re a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.',N'A solid overview of Dreamweaver CS5',1287532800,NULL,NULL,NULL),     (4.0,N'False',1,N'10 18, 2010',N'A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ',0321719816,N' DVD-ROM',N'Grimmy',N'The demo is done with the PC version, with references to the Mac version when needed. The video is closed-captioned. You can set bookmarks. There are self-tests for each chapter as well.  Starts off with "what is HTML" and some other basic stuff. Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on "the best way to lay out a site using CSS" or anything like that. For that, you''ll need a book or two on that subject.  She has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it''s a decent introduction to creating web sites.  She sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking''s voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it''s not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.  UI - at the top of the interface, there''s a "Previous Video" button and "Next Video" button. The "Next Video" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you''ll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read "Take Test" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.  There''s a "Watch and Work" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you''ll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.

There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is "Certified Associate," approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.  With this software you''ll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You''ll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from "Adobe Certified Instructors", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.  For the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a "test" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.  If you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I''ll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need. I''ve simply listed the few words under the contents and have tried to briefly explain what you''ll be learning on the videos.

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I''m embarrassed to say what version I am using.  When I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW''s capabilities.  It''s now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.  As for the value of the training - I couldn''t be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.  Personally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won''t.) or checking my version of DW.    What this is   - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process   - A wonderfully designed interface   - A great overview of using DW  What it isn''t   - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)   - An expert tips and tricks reference  All in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author''s delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.  But all in all, this is an absolutely wonderful product.',N'A Fantastic Overview of Dream Weaver and Web Design in General',1286841600,NULL,NULL,NULL),     (4.0,N'False',1,N'10 7, 2010',N'A31ICLWQ9CSHRS',0321719816,N' DVD-ROM',N'Al Swanson',N'I decided (after trying a number of other products) to switch to the gold standard of web site management, Dreamweaver. I bought a few books, did some Lynda courses and still found myself wanting more. This was the perfect product for that "more".  I think some reviewers are confused about both Dreamweaver and this product - these aren''t for "design". If you don''t already know what you want to do, picking up Dreamweaver is not going to help! The product being reviewed here is how to use Dreamweaver - not how to design for the web. Both expect you already have the design part.  I used a pure HTML editor, which for beginners is the best way to go. You''ll learn HTML and CSS along with exactly how your code changes your page. DW is more for time savings and automation. That said, it''s also massively complex with a steep learning curve. And that''s where Learn Adobe Dreamweaver comes in. It very clearly takes you through learning DW so that you can get on with designing web pages.  Excellent addition to my library and excellent companion to Dreamweaver itself. The only other thing you might need is one of the large reference books on DW to refer back to if you have questions.',N'Excellent Tutorials!',1286409600,NULL,NULL,NULL),     (4.0,N'False',1,N'09 26, 2010',N'A2BVNVJOFXGZUB',0321719816,N' DVD-ROM',N'J.

The lesson starts with very fundamental knowledge of what an URL is and allow the students to know what is the source code, the layout and how to use the tools and maneuver in the Dreamweaver app. It is an excellent tool to have. Most of us uses some of the tools but not all of the tools.  Some I don''t even know the function was there. It is nice to have a teacher like this I can go to easily without calling expensive tech support.

Spent years with it. Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I''m tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won''t because this is about the video.  The opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.  I''m holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide. At some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it. But from what I can see after viewing a bunch of the video tutorials, it is the easiest way to indoctrinate you to the newest version.

This video in comparison is quite a bit better in terms of the rich contents and course layout. The video has 17 sections covering the key elements of CS5 which allow the user to learn how to create a local web site from scratch and uploading it to the server. Each section is also broken down to several 3-6 minutes sub-sections which is just right in terms of the duration. At the end of each section there is also a test available to make sure you get a good understanding of the materials.  There are also some other additional useful features such as real-time caption and bookmarks which allows us to jump to our favorite section easily.

Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so you''ll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.  The videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error ("Fireworks" for "Firefox," say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.  Since each video looks at just one issue, it''s very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the "Watch and work" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.  New features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.  If you''re upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you''re a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice. It''s probably not enough for the absolute beginner -- you''ll still need to learn HTML and CSS and web design theory, but this is the best I''ve seen for using Dreamweaver in particular.',N'Buy this with your copy of Dreamweaver',1288224000,6,NULL,NULL),     (3.0,N'False',1,N'10 21, 2010',N'A2VWE5SGNDS8HW',0321719816,N' DVD-ROM',N'tachi1',N'I waited to complete the entire course before writing this review and, in no particular order, these are my observations.  I should tell you that my web skills are limited. I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I''m in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn''t purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it''s going to teach you how to implement it. Don''t expect inspiration.  POSITIVE: * Level: absolute beginner to intermediate. *  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course. * The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation. * The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation. * The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away. * The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end. * Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you''re in in a public place where you can''t turn on the sound. * All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model. * I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it''s just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.  NOT SO POSITIVE: * Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can''t recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered. * The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting. * There is no "search" function or "index." This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn''t. * For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.) * The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a "personal index" these bookmarks have their limits.  On the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.  Video and online courses teach you very well how to build their sample websites, but when you are stumped on YOUR website, you need to be able to supplement the general principles they taught you with a more on-point reference.',N'Competent introduction to Dreamweaver and web principles.',1287619200,22,NULL,NULL),     (4.0,N'False',1,N'10 13, 2010',N'A13700AF4X40YG',0321700945,N' DVD-ROM',N'Loves Books in MD',N'As someone who has just upgraded from Lightroom version 2 to the new version 3, I got this to bring me up to speed on the new features.

In this mode, the video plays in a small window while you''re working in Lightroom. This lets you try the commands along with the video.  Video and audio quality is excellent.

I''d like to learn Lightroom because I''ve owned it for a while. I tried to use it but did not understand it so I went back to using Adobe Bridge, which is think is generally under-appreciated. I love Photoshop but tend to spend a lot of time with it, so the supposed time-saving features of Lightroom would be helpful.  I really hoped this product would make it easy for me to use Lightroom. Unfortunately I had trouble staying alert through more than 3 or 4 lessons at a time, and that much only covers a small portion of the material.  I don''t think this is because of the presenters so much as it is the difficulty of covering this sort of material in a video format.  The Introduction alone consists of 26 videos. It seemed like a commercial for Lightroom rather than a tutorial. Seven of the lessons are devoted to "What''s New" -- not too relevant for beginners. On the plus side, there were plenty of screen shots to familiarize us with the look of the software.  Unit 2 has 11 video lessons on importing pictures.

The series does an excellent job of not only giving you a general tour and reference to what is available in Lightroom, but also diving into more important aspects that you do not pick up on out of the gate.  Watching the entire video in one sitting is probably not feasible since it''s ten hours of content.  In fact, finding the time to watch the entire ten hours at all might be difficult.  Don''t be fooled though as any time you invest in going through this video will improve your usage of Lightroom.  It really depends on what you want out of Lightroom.  If you are just wanting some simple organization and editing you won''t need this video or certainly won''t need all of it.

I used to use Photoshop to manage and edit digital images, but switched to LR totally from then. LR is relatively user-friendly, you need very little instruction to get started. I never had any training, book or instructions of anykind, but always felt efficient with the software.  Well, I think it is great that I now have access to this training video. It was kind of long (10 hrs.), so finding the time to watch them was a challenge. Especially for me, as I already know how to use the software. But of course, you will pick up things that you don''t know before or how to do it better. And it is true. I learned more than I expected. So no matter how experienced you are or how user-friendly the software is, you will definitely gain something from it.  If you are a new user of LR, it could be a little intimidating. If you are a casual user who only need to manage your photo and run slideshow, you don''t need this video.

I''d worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book/dp/0321701801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book</a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didn''t know or that wasn''t clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.  There are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There''s no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.  The focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don''t get very advanced, and by the end of things you''d really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you''ve learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that''s a bit frustrating - in a beginner''s level textbook it''s easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it''s harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That''s one reason to prefer something like the "Classroom in a Book" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.  One thing I got here more clearly than in the "Classroom in a Book" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an "object based" language - even though you''d only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you''d have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don''t make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it''s available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).  Overall, it''s a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on "Best Practices" serves as a useful complement to the "how to" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I''d like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the "Next Video" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the "Next Video" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. "Hawaiin" instead of "Hawaiian"), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the "inverseKinematics_start.fla" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.',N'A helpful introduction to Flash CS5 - a bit dry, perhaps, but very clear and useful explanations and great on "best practices"',1290816000,NULL,NULL,NULL),     (4.0,N'False',1,N'10 21, 2010',N'A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ',0321719824,N' DVD-ROM',N'Grimmy',N'The presenter here sounds much more natural than the semi-robotic delivery found in the DreamWeaver tutorial product.  The lessons are broken up into easily digested 3-5 minute chunks, covering aspects of Flash from project planning and defining customer needs to an introduction to ActionScript fundamentails. Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. You''ll learn the fundamentals; you won''t learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that''s for a more advanced class.  As with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there''s a "Previous Video" button and "Next Video" button. The "Next Video" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you''ll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read "Take Test" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.  There''s a "Watch and Work" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you''ll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.  All in all it''s a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don''t have the patience for going through a book. Know what to expect; you''ll learn the basics, but you''ll need to carry on the learning process yourself, by seeking out more advanced information or learning materials.',N'A good introduction to Flash, with some UI weaknesses',1287619200,NULL,NULL,NULL),     (4.0,N'False',1,N'10 10, 2010',N'A31N0XY2UTB25C',0321719824,N' DVD-ROM',N'Stephanie Sullivan',N'This certified associate courseware comes as a package containing a DVD-ROM plus supplemental written material.

It covers the very basics and this might be off-putting to people with experience using MS Windows. The presentation voices are modulated and interesting. They are personable and the viewer gets an, "in classroom," feel which improved the effectiveness of the lessons for me.  Some people learn better by working along with the instructor. This video course provides the necessary files to do this and complete the tutorial as it is watched.  The narrator leaves plenty of time for this.  For those who learn best by listening and watching the pace of presentation designed for working along with the presentation it will seem to move slowly. The supplemental material is a good reference for after you have completed the video lesson.  The video creates a foundation of basic skills needed and the reference reinforces the lesson.  The materials are a good reference to use while one is using the program.  All in all I found this lesson to be a useful introduction to using Flash CS5.

The course provides a good introduction to the  CS5 user interface, the Flash tools, file types, and managing the timeline.  There''s also a very basic chapter that introduces ActionScript (AS3), which is the coding language used to create complex logic in a Flash application. The AS3 material is extremely basic--too basic in my opinion.  Again, I like the production of this video package. The videos can be played in Windows, Mac, or Linux. There are also MP4 versions of the video files, in case you want to view them on a portable device (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, etc.).

The full review: More to the point though, Office has become a different animal than it was.  In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.  So what exactly are you getting here?  This package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you''re on a machine that doesn''t have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called "OneDrive" (formerly known as "SkyDrive") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.  It''s ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That''s the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife''s PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I''ve been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.  This package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you''re afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.  Which brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they''re still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I''ve seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure ("the Cloud", a.k.a., "on the Internet") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the "Kanban" look that you also see in Windows 8''s "Metro-now-called-Modern" apps and parts of Windows 10''s look and feel.  My rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.  You also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don''t want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose "Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There''s no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.  The Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines. The Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines. The Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.  Overall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don''t get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it''s cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or "bonus feature" - I wouldn''t rely solely on those for everyday work.

R. Jeanclerc',N'The current trend for software companies is to provide "software as a service" (SaaS) where the user licenses an application for a finite amount of time.  There are pros and cons for the user here - since it''s basically cloud-delivered, you don''t need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don''t pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that''s still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won''t) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won''t use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.  Installation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install.  You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.  In use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I don''t feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I''m not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).',N'Yep - You''re Renting Office Now - Get Used to It!',1381968000,NULL,NULL,NULL),     (4.0,N'False',1,N'10 16, 2013',N'A16QODENBJVUI1',0763855553,NULL,N'Robert Moore',N'Innovation is a good thing when the point of innovation is to improve one''s products and to enhance the experience of ones customers. But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft''s business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.  As a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.  So imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).  And to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft''s customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.  Now, that doesn''t mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I''m impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I''m still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I''m delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.',N'A kinder, gentler Microsoft',1381881600,NULL,NULL,NULL),     (4.0,N'False',1,N'10 13, 2013',N'A376OJHLE6SU9Q',0763855553,NULL,N'M. Wolf',N'First let me say the updates that have occured in Office over the past few updates have been GREAT!  If you are thinking about updating your version of office this is a great thing to consider.  However, many software companies are doing this "rent" the software idea.  I like that the Office 2007 I own is mine and I can use it for as long as I have a computer that runs it.  One thing I really like about this Office version is that it contains Outlook at a somewhat reasonable price point.  I really like using Outlook at home (I have my own domain name so it is kind of a necessity for me).  The whole "cloud" thing is concern.  There may be files that I will be willing to put there however while it may be more secure (from hackers) than my home computer the court decisions on data I''ve "shared" with other vendors may not have as strong of legal protection as my home hard disk. (NPR did an interesting story on this)  All that being said I love the idea of being able to access document that I''ve been working on at home from other locations.',N'Mixed thoughts...',1381622400,NULL,NULL,NULL),     (4.0,N'False',1,N'10 8, 2013',N'A1E5WXNTI7EO2A',0763855553,NULL,N'Sarah B.',N'I have to admit that one of my paranoid fears is that my computer will crash and that I''ll lose all of my files and projects that I''ve spent a long time working on. One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you''re offline and then they''ll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don''t have internet access, then you won''t be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.  An added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can''t make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won''t work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.  Installation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year''s access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you''ll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I''m OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.  It did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you''re OK with that, then I think you''ll enjoy Office 365. It''s user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that''s increasingly mobile and connected. I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am.',N'Annual expense, but some neat benefits',1381190400,NULL,NULL,NULL),     (4.0,N'False',1,N'09 30, 2013',N'AEJAGHLC675A7',0763855553,NULL,N'John Williamson',N'For most of us, Microsoft Office is the de-facto standard of office suites, with Word being the predominant program. It wasn''t always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn''t for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.  There are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from ''Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.  Please note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.  Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.   Likes:  + Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless + Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed + Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users + Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email + SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed + Easy customization once installed; make it work your way   Rants & Irritants:  - Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don''t like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat   Installation:  The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it''s a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.  Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you''ll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.  What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won''t attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.   SkyDrive:  I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you''re logged in.   Word:  The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I''ve found working on clients'' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.  Among the new additions that I''ve found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.   Excel:  On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I''ve used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.  But now there''s a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It''s well worth it.   OneNote:  This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.   PowerPoint:  There''s a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.   Outlook:  There''s an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I''ve been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I''m currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.   Publisher:  I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you''ll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.   Access:  The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.   Annoyances & Irritants:  My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I''m trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I''ll change it. As noted earlier, I don''t like the "new" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It''s essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.   Suggestions:  Putting this simply, if you''re happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a ''clean'' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a ''regular'' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.  I have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.

Of course, there will always be some things that can be done without, like having to select a new page, or blank workbook from among templates every time the program is opened, or the cutesy graphics around the borders of the applications.

This version contains Word for word processing, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, OneNote to help keep you and projects organized, and Outlook to manage your email.  This is the version that can be installed on up to five devices and is only valid for a one year subscription.  I''m not a fan of this type of subscription, but the cost is lower than buying the one pc version, and this can be used on windows tablets and phones, as well.  It''s just a matter of determining how you will use this software and deciding which version is right for you.  For those who prefer cloud storage, 27GB on MS SkyDrive is included with this subscription.  This means you can log in from any pc and access the documents you have stored there.

If you are updating from Office 2007 or 2010, you shouldn''t have too much of a learning curve.  The change from Office 2003 (if you are still using that version) is pretty drastic, though.

As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don''t tell the boss about this).  The new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the "theme" chosen. Pretty unexciting.  As far as functionality goes, Office hasn''t changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on "File" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer''s toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.  Office 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC''s or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.  Microsoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it''s not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating.

You can install this five times on five different computers which means that if you split the costs with four others you end up paying less than $20 a year (though Microsoft won''t guarantee the price will be the same next year). You get the use of Office 365 days a year, with any improvements that transpire during that time.  I like Office considerably, and this is basically Office 2013. Because I use Office a lot, I''m used to things that people get upset about. For instance, I feel very positive about the Ribbon which other people don''t like.

From there you have the option of saving it to your documents, which is a private folder, or to Shared/Public folder. (I uploaded a screenshot of this menu at the top of the Amazon product page).  The public folder is ideal for sharing videos and other large files with friends, family, etc. Microsoft hasn''t quite perfected the public sharing side, but it is close.

After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn''t take me long to realize that glo was good to go.  The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you''ve never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.  Things glo has improved upon:  ++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.  There are "lenses" that "distribute content over a zoomable interface," media containers, a result''s grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.  ++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.  ++  The user can check out the "contributors and sources" on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.  ++  There is a "Quick Install" option (I didn''t opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.  ++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.  ++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.  The only thing I didn''t find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.  Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I can''t fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, I''ll give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.  In this "revolutionary new Bible" (NIV study Bible) you''ll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies.  GLO features:  ++  450+ Virtual Tours   These are 360-degree tours of "modern-day and re-created" ancient biblical locations."  ++  3.5 Hours of HD Videos   You''ll be able to enjoy the "In His Shoes" HD interactive documentary.  ++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos   The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph.  ++  7,500+ Articles   The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading plan  Take for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria.  There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings.  I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article.  ++  650+ Works of Art  ++  Integration with the best web content  ++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program  ++  Concise, compact organization through five "lenses"  ++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you study  LENSES:  BIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily.  TIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the Creation  MyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and "reading plans."  MEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more.

From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.  Many have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.  The initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn''t significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.  This product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.  The best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.

There is nothing quite as pleasant as sitting in front of a monitor and just going from verse to verse but having those verses explained in a way the layman can fully understand some of the background.  For comparison I have a 1810 version of The King James Bible that has been passed down from several generations and is quite used.  The words, however, come through and are the same.  The annotations for each page, where applicable, are similar to GLO''s annotations except the time in years actually makes a difference.  That''s a good thing and GLO does it well.  I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait.

Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you''re reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.  GLO''s gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu''s darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple''s love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you''re reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it''s a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.  Be forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I don''t doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.  The one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really don''t know how to process all this information. I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit.

It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you.

In this day and age of multimedia everything, and online that, and Twitter this...  It''s kind of inevitable that a multimedia bible like this would exist.  One issue though.  Installation takes awhile if you want to put everything on your hard drive.  There are three DVD''s in the package, and the default installation just goes from Disc 1.  That''s not too bad.  But if you want to do the "full" installation, it took me about an hour to install all the data from the other two DVD,s which is pretty slow for a disc based install.  I''ve installed multi disc programs before, and they haven''t taken anywhere near that amount of time.

Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.  WillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC''s from the 1980''s.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that''s it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.  I wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn''t permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my "final intentions" are. I can''t imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say "give it all to so-and-so".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they''ve admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.  I think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. It''s not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the "list price" of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.  The only reason I''m giving it 2 stars is that it does give you the convenience of having some basic forms all on one disk, a bit of a timesaver.

I liked the 2009 version.  Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move.  (Also, you''re supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*.  If you don''t, the software won''t update itself after the end of the version year -- i.e., Dec. 31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws.)  This 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo''s online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again.  Other than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products.  Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations.  How simple?  For example, in my case I''d like to attach a condition to my will that the people I''d like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.  It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker.  What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself.  This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my state''s will law to make sure my language is kosher.  I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt'' write it for me -- will pass on probate.  For most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc.  You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills.  Another thing I''m disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is it''s little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before.  The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains.  It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version.  (And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesn''t come with living trusts built-in.)  I find this practice unethical.  Most likely this will be the last version of Willmaker I''ll use.  I wasn''t going to use the 2011 version, but got a chance to try it for free, hence I used it and this review.  There''re books out there that show you step-by-step how to make wills and living trusts, books published by Nolo and by big-name publishers.

Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application.  Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information.  I''d suggest buying their books instead.  The program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms.  In these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesn''t remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again.  Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there.  When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.  Many of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.  Included in the program are "checklists"  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as "How to Form an LLC" and "How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting".  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.  Most frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated "Book Reader" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager''s Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.  Additionally, also included with the program is a printed book called "Your Little Legal Companion" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as "Moving in with your Lover" and "Getting Old." These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.  Upon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book "101 Law Forms for Personal Use".  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.

(Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)  That said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more. So I''ll go ahead and comment on the old version we''ve used:  First, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state''s bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you''re like me and don''t have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.  I will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you''ve ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).  All of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.  I don''t really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don''t know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.  Also, none of the forms were usable "as-is" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).  Nonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it''s all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it''s not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.',N'Really for individuals & small business ...

That means 120 years of one of the world''s most amazing magazines, all digitized and capable of being loaded onto your computer.  The nice part about this collection is that every issue of the magazine is reproduced as exactly as possible (barring some "printing" errors here and there):  every page, complete with ads, and all photos vividly reproduced, representing over 50GB of material.  The bad part is that every issue of this magazine is reproduced exactly:  they are issues that you flip through, page by page, with a Table of Contents.  The interface takes some getting used to, and the search engine leaves a bit to be desired.  The program can also be a little slow to respond, particularly when it first loads.  Drilling down to specifics is not as easy as idly thumbing through issues, and thumbing through issues can also be a bit tedious.  It''s important to keep in mind that the National Geographic Society are not Wikipedia:  information presented here was the well researched and chronicled *at the time of printing*--older issues will not be brought up to date with the world''s latest discoveries.  This collection exists simply as a way to see the massive collection of the National Geographic Society that spans over a century of traveling the world and absorbing its information.

Durney',N'National Geographic is one of the items that is part of the fabric of our lives.  Every one of us, from somewhere, remembers reading them as a child.  Pictures of faraway places, animals and people different from us stoked our imaginations while creating a sense of wonder that such things existed.  Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases.  This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box.  Each issue is presented page by page, starting at the front cover and proceeding to the back cover.  All the maps are here too.  The set shows the world as it was and the process of changing into the world of today.  This is a living history lesson showing how America changes and adjusts into the modern world. I am running this on a 64-bit VISTA system with no problems.  Print quality is excellent in even the 1888 issues.  A page magnifier is available but I have not found it necessary.  Photo quality varies over time.  The early issues have poor quality photographs because the printing process was not that great.  You can view all of the old photos but many are not that clear an image.  The interface is not intuitive but it is not impossible to use either.  I have several of these collections and cannot comment of how a first time user will find this.  There are better interfaces but this is not an impossible one and it is fully supported. Is it worth it?  That depends on you.  Can you lose yourself in looking at pictures of Europe in 1925?  Would you want to read about the Pacific Northwest in the 1930?  Can you spend a couple of hours looking at advertisement of products that no longer exist?  When was the last time you bought an icebox or considered buying a Cord?

If you install the software and use the update option in Preferences to install the latest update then you get an option to specify where the DVD data is stored, and you just need to copy the contents of the disk1-6 folders from each disk to that location. Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).  Note that you''ll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!  The developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a "copy everything to disk" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now. The web site to follow for the latest info is COMPLETENATGEO.  This version of the Complete National Geographic is *much* improved over the one from several years ago. The viewing application is a much nicer application, it scales the images to the size of the application window nicely, and the full two-page spread images are quite readable on a 24" 1920x1200 monitor.
